What kind of files are we referring to?
Which would be the source and destination of this files?
Are we currently able to upload a single file per day, but not more? Or is the PBI referring not to a daily cap, but to be able to upload multiple files at once to save time?
Do we want this files to be automatically or manually uploaded?
